# Scratch Accounts & 02Engine

While you can't sign in to your Scratch account on 02Engine (any website other than scratch.mit.edu that asks you for your Scratch password is a SCAM -- no exceptions), you can still run projects without sharing them, upload projects to Scratch, and use your own username.

**To run a project made in Scratch using 02Engine without sharing it**: Use File > Save to your computer in the Scratch editor to save the project to a file on your computer, and select that file using File > Load from your computer in 02Engine.

**To upload a project made in 02Engine to Scratch**: Use File > Save to your computer in 02Engine's editor to save the project to a file on your computer, and select that file using File > Load from your computer in Scratch's editor.

**To change your username in 02Engine**: Use Edit > Change Username.

Even if you're signed in to Scratch in another tab, 02Engine can't access it because browsers prevent websites from being able to access login credentials of other websites (This is what keeps online banking safe). We would have to ask you for your Scratch password which would add unfixable security horrors and probably get us blocked by Scratch.

Depending on what you're trying to do, you might find success using the [02Engine Packager](https://packager.02engine.org/) to be able to upload your project to generic HTML or game hosting sites.
